# LIS 545 Term Project

## Description
These files make up my term project for LIS 545. 
"MOMA_data_2022" is a .xlsx file that lists all the works on view at the Museum of Modern Art on February 1, 2022. 
"LIS 5454 Final Report" is a .pdf file that accompanies the data, explaining what it is, and what repository is suitable for it. 
"Metadata" is an xml file that lists the structured metadata 

## Usage
This project could be used to identify demographics of the artists typically on view in major museum institutions. 

## Credits
"MOMA_data_2022" was taken off of kaggle.com, and https://www.makeareadme.com/ was used to help write this readme file.
